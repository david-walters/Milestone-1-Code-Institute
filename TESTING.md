Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

During development I made use of google developer tools to ensure everything was working correctly and to assist with troubleshooting when things were not working as expected.

I have gone through each page using google chrome developer tools & Firefox inspector tool to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices and to ensure that the keyframes also work on different browsers.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

- [index.html](assets/images/testing-images/w3-index.PNG) - Passed/No-errors.
- [about-me.html](assets/images/testing-images/w3-about-me.PNG) - Passed/No-errors
- [contact.html](assets/images/testing-images/w3-contact.PNG) - Passed/No-errors
- [portfolio.html](assets/images/testing-images/w3-portfolio.PNG) - Passed/No-errors

- [style.css](assets/images/testing-images/w3-css.PNG) - Passed/No-errors

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

### Desktop Results

All pages of the site are achieving a score of 100 for accessibility, best practices, and SEO. All pages achieve 98 or more for performance.

### Mobile Results

Each page is achieving a score of 100 for the last three categories. The performance category is achieving a score of 98 for the first three pages and a score of 99 on the 404 & 500 page.
